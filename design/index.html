<h2>Wordmark Project</h2>
<p>As a project for a document design course, I was required to create a perception of the word randomly assigned to me using nothing but the letters in that word.  These images represent three different versions of the same design concept.</p>

<h2>Program Cover</h2>
<p>A team project to design the cover for the 2010 Midwest Museum Association Conference.  The cover was modified and selected by the client (click <a href="http://www.midwestmuseums.org/pdfs/2010_prelim_program.pdf">here</a> to view the final design).  All three versions represent different types of distribution methods: color, for the final program cover; grayscale, for black and white printing applications; and a JPEG web image, for attaching to email announcements.</p>
