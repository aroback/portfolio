	<h2>Ph.D. Candidate in Technical Communication</h2>
		<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, 2009-Present</h3>

				<p>I am currently researching social networks, social network analysis (SNA), and technology mediated social participation (TMSP) for my qualifying exam paper and I plan to begin writing my dissertation in  May of 2012.  I am a member of the <a href="http://www.casmlab.org/">Collaboration and Social Media (CaSM) Lab</a> supervised by <a href="http://www.libbyh.com/">Dr. Libby Hemphill</a>.  My other research interests include human-computer interaction (HCI), textual analysis, information visualization, and social action in technical communication.</p>

	<h2>M.A. in English and American Literature</h2>
		<h3>DePaul University, Chicago, 2008</h3>

				<p>I conducted research of technical detail in fiction (e.g. how authors create believability in fiction through the inclusion of technical detail), specifically how authors incorporated details of socioeconomic and class differences to engage period audiences in fiction and drama.  I graduated with distinction (3.95 GPA), accumulating a wide variety of experience in research throughout my program.</p>
				
	<h2>B.A. in Liberal Arts and Sciences</h2>
		<h3>University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 2004</h3>
			
				<p>While enrolled, I was an Illinois State Scholar and Dean's List recipient who maintained a 3.5 major GPA.  In my senior year I participated in an innovative research project under <a href="http://www.nancyabelmann.com/">Dr. Nancy Ablemann</a>, the <a href="http://www.eui.illinois.edu">Ethnography of the University</a> project, where I conducted instructor supervised, IRB approved ethnographic research.  I also completed a double major in English and Rhetoric.</p>

	<h2>Humanities 106: Life Stories</h2>
			<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: Fall 2009, Spring 2010, Fall 2010, (Fall 2011)</h3>
				
				<p>A course covering the different genres of writing (autobiography, biography, memoir, creative non-fiction) that tell individuals' stories.  Different iterations of my section have included readings from Benjamin Franklin, Harriet Jacobs, Frederick Douglass, Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, Martin Luther King Jr., Tim O'Brien, Dave Eggers, and David Sedaris.  In addition to introducing literary research to freshman students, this course covers historical context and philosophical concepts that allow students to engage texts critically through written work, supplemented by instructor and peer feedback at all stages of the writing process.</p>

	<h2>Literature 309: Short Fiction</h2> 
		<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: Spring 2010</h3>
				
				<p>This course featured selections of less frequently anthologized short fiction pieces, as well as a few classics.  The goal of the course was to introduce students to this genre, collectively formulate the fundamental tenets, explore how the evolution of this genre over the past two centuries, and question why short fiction is still a relevant and an integral part of media we consume today.  For their final projects, I encouraged students to go beyond writing a term paper and several students developed collages, photography portfolios, and websites/multimedia content.</p>

	<h2>Literature 380: Shakespeare: Print, Screen, and Stage</h2>
		<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: Fall 2010</h3>
				
				<p>A literature class where students read Shakespeare and compared the text of his plays to film and stage performances, including a trip to the Chicago Shakespeare Theater.  Students performed close readings of the plays and examined contextual material to gain insight into Shakespeare's writing.  This course also included sections on the vocabulary and theory of film and stage criticism, with an emphasis on applying those concepts to both traditional and interpretive films and performances.</p>
				
	<h2>Literature 315: The Novel</h2>
		<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: Spring 2011</h3>
		
			<p>This course focused on the historical progression of the novel as a genre from the proto-novels of the 18th century through postmodern and contemporary titles.  I provided audio feedback on response papers (in the form of .mp3 files) and we preformed in-class research and undertook a collaborative Wikipedia editing exercise.</p>
			
	<h2>Literature 380: Hard Times</h2>
		<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: Spring 2011</h3>
			
			<p>A look at historical class conflicts as portrayed in literature.  Students read and researched novels concerning times of economic difficulty and political upheaval, and worked in teams to research contextual information on the time periods we read about.  I concluded the semester with a look at the the global financial crisis and economic recession.</p>
			
	<h2>Literature 380: The Graphic Novel</h2>
		<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: (Fall 2011)</h3>
			<p>This course will offer a review of comics theory and sequential art as discussed in the works of Scott McCloud and Will Eisner.  We'll also be reading major contributions to the genre in the U.S. and looking at the history of sequential art. I will add more details to this description later this year.</p>

	<h2>Writing Center Tutor</h2>
			<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: Fall 2009</h3>
				<p>As a writing center tutor at IIT, I adopted a directive approach in assisting students in their writing projects.  I assisted students primarily with projects relating to scientific reports and papers, art and architectural history, and professional development documents such as r&#233;sum&#233;s, CV's, and applications for graduate study.</p>

	<h2>Writing Consultant</h2>
		<h3>DePaul University: 2006-2008</h3>
				<p>My approach to tutoring writing at <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/writing/">the DePaul University Center for Writing-based Learning</a>  involved a balance between directive and non-directive strategies.  For instance, I advocated for and employed much more directive strategies for English as a Target Language (ETL) students as a result of my experiences collaborating with the <a href="http://ela.depaul.edu/">English Language Academy</a>.  As a consultant, I worked with hundreds of students from various disciplines both in-person and through distance collaboration.</p>

	<h2>Freelance Writing Consultant</h2>
		<h3>2008-Present</h3>
				<p>In my work as a freelance writing consultant I have mainly worked with graduate students on completing degree requirement writings such as dissertation proposals, and in one case, an entire dissertation.  I also have experience working with academic professionals to improve their professional and business writing skills.</p>

	<h2>The Impact of Emerging Literacies on Instant Messaging and Supplemental Writing Instruction</h2>
		<h3>Computers and Writing: 5/21/10, Purdue University</h3>
				
				<p>A mini-workshop where participants briefly simulated a writing center tutorial conducted through a web-based instant messaging application (Google Docs) in order to gain an understanding of the complexities of the literacy that has emerged from this media and how that literacy expands and reshapes writing instruction.</p>

	<h2>Open Source Tutoring: An examination of the Role of Service-Learning in the Writing Center</h2>
		<h3>Chicagoland Writing Center Association Conference: 2/6/10, DePaul University</h3>
				
				<p>In this piece I introduced a concept called "Open Source Tutoring," a method of tutoring that both disseminates knowledge amongst peer tutors and reveals the processes of writing to tutees, preparing both parties to engage in reflexive and informed writing practices while also demystifying supplemental writing instruction.  Community outreach initiatives are often forced to reduce the tutoring process to a brief encounter (e.g. students visit the writing center with a college application personal statement for fifteen minutes on a college visit day).  Using open source practices (i.e. teaching students how to replicate the experience of providing writing consultation with their peers) and open source technology (e.g. free and open applications for writing) along with long-term engagement strategies helps maximize the impact of supplemental writing instruction outside of the university community.</p>


	<h2>Community, Collaboration, Cogitation: The Three "C's" of Tutor Training</h2>
		<h3>Chicagoland Writing Center Association Conference: 2/7/2009, North Park University</h3>
				
				<p>A review of progressive tutor training methods developed at the DePaul University Center for Writing-based learning, including the theoretical underpinnings for structured approaches to writing center administration: structuring time for professional development, community building, formal/informal collaboration, and critical reflection on tutoring approaches.  Coauthored with Laura Friddle, Rickie-Ann Legleitner, and Alexis Maloof.</p>

	<h2><a href="http://www.depaul.edu/magazine/articles/ss09Writing.asp">"The Decline of Writing?"</a></h2>
		<h3>DePaul Magazine: Spring/Summer 2009</h3>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.depaul.edu/magazine/articles/ss09Writing.asp">An article</a> that critically examines and debunks the myth that technology negatively impacts student writing ability.  Technology in fact provides a multitude of opportunities to write that were not present in the past.  Please note that although the article appears in a "question and answer" format, the magazine editor added those questions as section headers; the authors did not "respond" to the questions in the article when writing the article.  Coauthored with Lauri Dietz and Alexis Maloof.</p>

				<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=311970535&amp;ign-mpt=uo=6">A podcast</a> exploring issues in teaching and tutoring writing.

	<h2>Business Manager</h2>
		<h3>DePaul University Center for Writing-based Learning: August 2007- May 2009</h3>
			
			<p>I was responsible for tabulating statistics about student usage, evaluating employee performance, implementing new pedagogical procedures, composing training materials, and working with the director to ensure that the Writing Center operated efficiently and within budget by managing payroll hours for approximately 60 employees.  Additionally, I managed the UCWbL's web presence, including social media and a podcast.</p>

	<h2>Claims Adjuster, Independent Claims Adjuster</h2>
		<h3>National Claims Services: September 2005-August 2006</h3>
			
			<p>I settled moving damage claims with the United States Armed Services ranging in value and size from under a hundred dollars to over $30,000.  In addition to settling claims, I made several appeals before the federal board regulating Military-Industrial claims settlements in cases where a dispute prevented settlement.  I was also recognized by the president of NCS for my efforts to use Excel to simplify complex liability calculations.  As a member of the claims department, I provided customer service to men and women in the armed forces who had difficulty with their government-sponsored move.  After I left the company to return to graduate school, I remained as an outside consultant for two years.</p>
