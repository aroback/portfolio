<div id="content_area">
	<h2>Please read before continuing to survey</h2>
		<p>Thank you for your interest in the survey. Please have your Twitter username ready (you will need it to log in).</p>
		<p>Typically, I would ask you to complete the Facebook portion of the survey as well, but I was not able to retrieve posts from your organization's Facebook account. That being the case, you should skip the Facebook portion of the survey.</p>
	
	<h2>Why didn't you collect posts from my organization's Facebook account?</h2>
		<p>There are a few possible reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Your organization doesn't have an active Facebook account</p></li>
					<li><p>I did not find your Facebook account when I was collecting data</p></li>
					<li><p>There were no posts from your account during the period in which I was collecting data.</p></li>
				</ul>
		
	<h2>How do I skip the Facebook section?</h2>
		<p>You will see a link on the login page. When you click on it you will be automatically redirected to the Twitter portion of the survey where you will log in with your username.</p>
		
	<h2>What if I can't log in to the Twitter portion?</h2>
		<p>Please contact me at aroback@iit.edu with the message you received and I will try to correct the problem as soon as I can.</p>
