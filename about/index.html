	<h2>What I Do</h2>
		<p>Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://iit.edu">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> in the Technical Communication program and a predoctoral teaching fellow in the <a href="http://www.iit.edu/csl/hum/">Lewis Department of Humanities.</a>  I am expecting to graduate with a Ph.D. in Technical Communication in Spring of 2013.</p>
		
	<h2>My Work History</h2>
		<p>Although I graduated with a degree in English and Rhetoric from the University of Illinois, Urbana, most of my work experience involved a great deal of technical writing.  After graduating with my M.A. in English and American Literature from DePaul University, Chicago, I decided that I wanted to enter a field where I was able to continue with my work as a technical communicator.  My goal as a student is to bring my specialized knowledge of literature and composition to the field of technical communication.</p>
