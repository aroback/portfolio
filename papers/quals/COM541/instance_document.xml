					<p_quotation>"I think we're going to have to realize the situation of games a little better," U.S. captain Jamie Langenbrunner told NHL.com. "We got caught on some two-on-ones and three-on-twos late in the game, which we can't do. We have to realize the time and the score and play accordingly, play winning hockey. That'll come.
 
"Everybody wants to do their best out there and create things, and the more we get relaxed and the more we feel comfortable, we'll get better."</p_quotation>

					<c_quotation>"Yes, there are things we have to work on," Wilson said less than an hour after the win. "We have a game against Norway and they will provide a different set of problems."</c_quotation>
					<c_quotation>"You can't have a 35-minute practice and have everything work and clicking," the Toronto Maple Leafs coach said. "You don't have anybody that plays on the same line on their NHL teams."</c_quotation>
					<c_quotation>"We have to shoot the puck more and maybe be a little more selfish," Wilson said.</c_quotation>

				<fo_quotation>"I thought the Swiss did a really good job in their D-zone positioning when that line had the puck, so I don't think they had a lot of chances," Team USA GM Brian Burke said. "But they had good puck possession and good puck movement. They just didn't generate a lot of offense. That will come. I thought we over-passed the puck a lot today."</fo_quotation>

					<p_quotation>"To be honest, right when I found out I started to think," Parise said. "Granted I was still playing for the Devils, but you start to think about the way Stastny plays and where he likes to go on the ice. I know he likes to stop play behind the net a lot, so I think of what I can do and what does Kane like to do. You start to think what you can do to help these guys and make the line better."</p_quotation>

					<p_quotation>"You get a chance to understand what roles you are going to be in," Langenbrunner said. "We talked about top-six and bottom-six forwards, and that's pretty universal, and we understand what our role is going to be by what line you are put on, and it gives you a feeling that you can start visualizing playing with those guys a little bit. You know from playing in the League what certain guys do and how they play and what they bring to a team and you see how you can adapt your game to them."</p_quotation>
